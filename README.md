# LurkerHN

After using multiple Android apps to read Hacker News, I decided that I should build my own app according to my preferences. This project was a good opportunity to learn Android development. 

### Features

At the moment, I'm using this app on a daily basis to read HN. So far, it fits all my needs, which are:
- read the main three categories (top, new, best, show, ask)
- save stories to read them later
- easily share stories
- open a link in a webview (for quick reading) or default web browser
- choose default category & number of stories shown
- display comments in an ordered fashion
- mark stories according to their score, so that the most upvoted stories pop out


I should mention that the app is called "LurkerHN" because I just read and never post any stuff there. Therefore, that's why I was not interested in developing the login part and therefore, it's for lurkers.

### TODO:
- Maybe upload the app on Google Play?
