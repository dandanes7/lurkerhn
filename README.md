# LurkerHN

### Why?
After using multiple Android apps to read Hacker News, I decided to build my own app and implement all the features that I need.  
As of now, I am using this app on a daily basis to read HN.

### Features

- read the main categories (top, new, best, show, ask)
- save stories and read them later
- share stories 
- open a story URL in a webview (for quick reading) 
- open a story in the default web browser
- share stories
- choose default category & number of stories shown
- display comments in an ordered fashion
- expand comment fragments
- the most upvoted stories are marked out


It should be mentioned that the app is called "LurkerHN" because it is for lurkers (people that just read stuff but never post anything).
