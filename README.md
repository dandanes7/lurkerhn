# LurkerHN

After using multiple Android apps to read Hacker News, I decided that I should build my own app according to my preferences. This project was a good opportunity to start learn Android development. 

### Features

At the moment, I am using this app on a daily basis to read HN. So far, it fits all my needs:
- read the main categories (top, new, best, show, ask)
- save stories and read them later
- share stories 
- open a story URL in a webview (for quick reading) or default web browser
- choose default category & number of stories shown
- display comments in an ordered fashion
- mark stories according to their score, so that the most upvoted stories pop out


I should mention that the app is called "LurkerHN" because it is for lurkers (people that just read stuff but never post).
